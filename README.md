# "Ecological study measuring association between conflict, environmental factors, and annual global cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis incidence (2005 - 2022)" data
This repository contains one dataset: ModelVars.csv. In this study, we measured the association between conflict and leishmaniasis over 18 years while accounting for other factors, such as environmental conditions and population displacement, that are relevant to leishmaniasisâ€™ spread.



**Data Sources**

Cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis case data (case): [WHO Global Health Observatory](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/number-of-cases-of-cutaneous-leishmaniasis-reported)

Population (pop): [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) 

Conflict intensity (con_intens): [Bertelsmann Transformation Index](https://bti-project.org/en/index/governance) 

Gross domestic product (gdp): [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?view=chart) 

Internal displacement (displace_prop): [Internal Displacement Monitoring Center](https://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data/)

Precipitation (precip) and temperature (temp_mean, temp_range): [World Bank's Climate Change Knowledge Portal](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/)

Humidity (hum_mean, hum_range): [NASA's Global Land Data Assimilation System Land Surface Model](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets?keywords=GLDAS)

Normalized difference vegetation index (ndvi): [NASA's Terra MODIS](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD13A3)



**Data Specification**
- Confict intensity was lagged one year
- Displacement was included as a proportion of the total population and log-transformed
- GDP, precipitation, temperature, humidity, and NDVI were mean centered and standardized
- We included a random nation-level intercept


**Model Code**

We ran our model using the [mgcv](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf) package in R version 4.0.4. The final model (Model C in Table 1) uses the following code:

`gam(case ~ year + con_intens + displace_prop_log + gdp_scale + precip_scale + s(temp_mean_scale,k=-1) + s(temp_range_scale,k=-1) + s(ndvi_scale,k=-1) + hum_mean_scale + hum_range_scale + s(nation,bs="re"), offset=log(pop), family = nb, gamma=1.5, data=ModelVars, method="REML")`
